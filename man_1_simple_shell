.SH NAME
.B hsh
- simple version of sh command line interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
[command] [arguments]
.SH DESCRIPTION

A simple shell is a program that takes input from you in the form of commands, processes it, and then gives an output. It is the interface through which a user works on the programs and commands. A shell is accessed by a terminal which runs it.
When you run the terminal, you can type your input, which is then executed when you hit the Enter key. The output or the result is thereafter displayed on the terminal.

This simple shell can:

Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
Execute command lines with arguments.

Invocation

If no args are present and if the standard input of the shell is connected to a terminal (or if the -i flag is set), and the -c option is not present, the shell is considered an interactive shell.  An interactive shell generally.
If command line arguments besides the options have been specified, then the shell treats the first argument as the name of a file from which to read commands (a shell script), and the remaining arguments are set as the positional parameters of the shell ($1, $2, etc).  Otherwise, the shell reads commands from its standard input.

Command Exit Status

Each command has an exit status that can influence the behaviour of other shell commands.  The paradigm is that a command exits with zero for normal or success, and non-zero for failure, error, or a false indication.
The man page for each command should indicate the various exit codes and what they mean.  Additionally, the builtin commands return exit codes, as does an executed shell function.
If a command consists entirely of variable assignments then the exit status of the command is that of the last command substitution if any, otherwise 0.

EXIT STATUS

Errors that are detected by the shell, such as a syntax error, will cause the shell to exit with a non-zero exit status.  If the shell is not an interactive shell, the execution of the shell file will be aborted.  Otherwise the shell will return the exit status of the last command executed, or if the exit builtin is used with a numeric argument, it will return the argument.
